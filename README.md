Deep Neural Networks: Defect Segmentation on Textured Surfaces

In this project, you will be developing a model to detect defects by Industrial Optical Inspection on Textured Surfaces. This problem can be modelled as an Image Segmentation task where you will have to find the pixels where the defect occurs in a given image.

The dataset we will be using is described here:
https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/node/3616

There are many ways to solve this problem.We will attempt to solve this using deep learning and the approach we will follow is based on the paper on U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation.
